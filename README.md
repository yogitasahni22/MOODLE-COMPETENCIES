# MOODLE-COMPETENCIES
**We tried to make a good answer reliable attainment project that can be useful for our Institute for NBA.**

*GOAL - *Administrators can then set up competency frameworks and add competencies to them. See Competency frameworks for more information.
They can then create learning plan templates, add competencies to them and assign learning plans to individual selected students or to whole cohorts. See Learning plans for more information.**

**Day-1** I'm very glad to do project with my teachers and my mates.Firstly what I have to do as told by my mentor is to do installation of Moodle.So for that I downloaded the XAMPP by which I can setup the php and mysql platform for the moodle app.And after that with help of xampp application I'm able to start moodle app.Our team took much time for installation, but when the installation process was completed the happiness was ultimate for team and mentors.After installation the work assigned was to read the database for moodle application from php.And started understanding the database.The database having about 200+ table.The table I started was the course table.By which I able to understand how to add courses to my application. The main motive for our project is to get the attainment of each course outcome and then the attainment of final course, by which we can calculate the course attainment by the individual student.
